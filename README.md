# Sms-spam-detector
Sms-spam-detector is a machine learning model built using Natural Language Processing , TfidfVectorizer and CountVectorizer.The projext is built from scratch ,in which we have performed Data Cleaning ,EDA,Data preprocessing ,creating the model,training and tesing the model  and finally deploment .
The project is to make people familiar with concept of Natural Language Processing and some features of machine learing such as TfidfVectorizer and Count Vectorizer,
using these concepts we have made a sms spam detector which helps us to classify a message as a spam or ham . The accuracy of model is quite good ,but i am still working on it to make it more better .
